    <h1>Zomato Redesign</h1>

    <p>
        For our Summative Assessment held in college, our class was asked to redesign any food
                <br>
                delivery app in a way where you make it inconvenient for the user and convenient for the 
                <br>
                delivery partners. This is the submission I had presented. I played around with the visuals
                <br>
                so that the user gets confused and irritated. I also removed a few of the most convenient
                <br>
                features for the users such as 'saved addresses' and 'order again'. I also flipped the 
                <br>
                rating system so that there is no unfair reviews given to the delivery partners. The 
                <br>
                user will also be not given any information about the delivery partner apart from their
                <br>
                names. However, I have not made it too inconvenient for the user; or you could say it is
                <br>
                convenient enough for the user to return. I have maintained the design aesthetic of the 
                <br>
                original Zomato app.
