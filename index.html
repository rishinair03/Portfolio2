<h2>Zomato Redesign</h2>



<div class="p1">
    <p>I redesigned Zomato in a way where the delivery partner's convenience
        <br>
        is given priority over that of the customer's. This can help reduce
        <br>
        the discrimination and harsh treatment that delivery partners face.
        <br>
        This is a project I did for my assessment.

<h3>Party Popper</h3>


<div class="p2">
    <p>For my last class we were asked to code a basic interactive fiction.
        <br>
        It is surely one of the most challenging and exciting tasks I have
        <br>
        done. It is based around the reader being at a party, and at every
        <br>
        stage, the reader will be presented with a couple of options. The
        <br>
        option they choose eventually paves the path for the storyline. I 
        <br>
        intend on improving this code soon.

<h4>The Laundrywalla</h4>

<div class="p3">
    <p>
        This is an ongoing project that I am doing for my father's brand
        <br>
        'The Laundrywalla'. It is a websitr I am designing for his 
        <br>
        laundromat. I intend on giving it a classy look using a monochrome
        <br>
        palette most likely.
